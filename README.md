- Hello! and welcome to my profile! My name is Jordan Inoa and I'm a passionate web developer currently enrolled in Coding Dojo, set to graduate in fall of 2021.

- I'm a hard working and strong minded individual currently studying a full stack python track and I'm interested in pursuing a career in data science, working along the lines of machine learning and AI programming.
